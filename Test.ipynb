Python provides powerful tools for performing basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nLet's start by showcasing a few basic arithmetic operations:\n\n- Addition: The `+` operator is used for addition. For example, `2 + 3` will result in `5`.\n- Subtraction: The `-` operator is used for subtraction. For example, `7 - 4` will result in `3`.\n- Multiplication: The `*` operator is used for multiplication. For example, `5 * 6` will result in `30`.\n- Division: The `/` operator is used for division. For example, `10 / 2` will result in `5`.\n\nYou can perform these calculations directly in code cells within JupyterLite Notebook. Feel free to create new cells, try out different arithmetic expressions, and see the results instantly.\n",
